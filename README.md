How the app works  

To receive meal suggestions, the user must enter the time of day in the provided plain text field. For instance, if the user inputs "mid-morning" and clicks the submit button, a variety of food options suitable for that time of day will be displayed for the user to choose from. The first image below illustrates how everything will appear. 

To handle incorrect data input effectively, when the user inputs an invalid text or information. An error will show, accompanied by a message with specific instructions on the correct input format. This ensures that the app only accepts valid dietary restrictions, preventing errors and enhancing the overall user experience by guiding users on how to input their information correctly. The second image below illustrates how everything will appear. When there is an error

The use of a reset button: 

When the user clicks the reset button, it allows them to easily revert the application—or a specific section of it—to its original default settings. If a user makes a series of unintended changes or encounters an error, they can use the reset button as a quick way to restore the application to a known, stable state.
